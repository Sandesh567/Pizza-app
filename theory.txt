//Each array object is one route
createBrowserRoute()

<Outlet/>

//Data Fetching using Loader
1. create Loader
2. provide loader
3. provide loader to the page


const navigation = useNavigation();

  const isLoading = navigation.state === "loading";

  In Navigation there is a state idle and loading based on that we can 
  implement a loader component.

 errorElement: <Error />
 property of the route and component

//React router form component

=>className="w-72 input mb-8"

Breakpoint prefix	Minimum width	CSS
sm	40rem (640px)	  @media (width >= 40rem) { ... }
md	48rem (768px)	  @media (width >= 48rem) { ... }

//adding transition//

Just the above normal transition and duration of transition for colors

//focus means outline of the button when user hits the tab key
ring means shadow

focus:outline-none 
focus:ring 
focus:ring-yellow-300 
focus:ring-offset-2 //width of the ring

//cursor disabled 
disabled:cursor-not-allowed

//re-using any styles 

@layer components{
  .input(classname){ all the styles;
  }
}

and passing className="input" into the components

//re-using styles with react components.
create jsx for the button and recieve children and when button is needed then
simply use the button component with the styles.

 //bg-slate-200/20 - This means bg color slate and with opacity 20 %

 importing fonts 
 //Import fonts from google and paste it on the index.html
 then in tailwin.config.js 
 use this to set font: inside theme
 fontFamily: {
      pizza: "Roboto Mono, monospace",
    },

  if we put sans instead of pizza tailwind will inject the font
  in the whole app.  It will make the whole app font family to that
  font family.


  //fetching data without navigaion: useFetcher

useFetcher => 
sometimes we want to fetch data from another route , which is
not associated with current page, without causing navigation.

use data from menu route without user going there.
